        <span>WARNING: ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE</span><br />
        CNS stimulants, including Quillivant XR, other methylphenidate‐containing products, and amphetamines, have a high potential<br />
        for abuse and dependence. Assess the risk of abuse prior to prescribing, and monitor for signs of abuse and dependence while<br />
        on therapy.

    <li>Quillivant XR is contraindicated:<br />
        <ul class="isi-sublist">
            <li>In patients known to be hypersensitive to methylphenidate or other components of Quillivant XR. Hypersensitivity reactions such as<br />
                angioedema and anaphylactic reactions have been reported.
            </li>
            <li>During treatment with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), and also within 14 days following discontinuation of treatment with an<br />
                MAOI because of the risk of hypertensive crisis.

        </ul>

     <li>Sudden death, stroke and myocardial infarction have occurred in adults treated with CNS stimulants at recommended doses. Sudden<br />
                            death has occurred in pediatric patients with structural cardiac abnormalities and other serious cardiac problems, and in adults taking<br />
                            CNS stimulants at recommended doses for ADHD. Avoid use in patients with known structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy,<br />
                            serious cardiac arrhythmias, coronary artery disease, or other serious cardiac problems. Further evaluate patients who develop exertional<br />
                            chest pain, unexplained syncope, or arrhythmias during treatment with Quillivant XR.
</li>
                            <li>CNS stimulants cause an increase in blood pressure (mean increase approximately 2‐4 mm Hg) and heart rate (mean increase<br />
                                approximately 3‐6 bpm). Some individuals may have larger increases. Monitor all patients for hypertension and tachycardia.
                            </li>
                            <li>Use of stimulants may cause psychotic or manic symptoms in patients with no prior history, or exacerbation of symptoms in patients with<br />
                                pre‐existing psychiatric illness. Evaluate for bipolar disorder prior to Quillivant XR use.

                                attention should be sought if signs or symptoms of prolonged penile erections or priapism are observed.

                            <li>Stimulants used to treat ADHD are associated with peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud’s phenomenon. Signs and symptoms are<br />
                            usually intermittent and mild; however, very rare sequelae include digital ulceration and/or soft tissue breakdown. Careful observation for<br />

                            <li>CNS stimulants have been associated with weight loss and slowing of growth rate in pediatric patients. Growth should be monitored<br />
