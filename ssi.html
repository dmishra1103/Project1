    <p>
        <span>WARNING: ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE</span><br />
        CNS stimulants, including Quillivant XR, other methylphenidate‐containing products, and amphetamines, have a high potential<br />
        for abuse and dependence. Assess the risk of abuse prior to prescribing, and monitor for signs of abuse and dependence while<br />
        on therapy.

<ul class="isi-list">
    <li>Quillivant XR is contraindicated:<br />
        <ul class="isi-sublist">
            <li>In patients known to be hypersensitive to methylphenidate or other components of Quillivant XR. Hypersensitivity reactions such as<br />
                angioedema and anaphylactic reactions have been reported.
            </li>
            <li>During treatment with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), and also within 14 days following discontinuation of treatment with an<br />
                MAOI because of the risk of hypertensive crisis.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Stroke and myocardial infarction have occurred in adults treated with CNS stimulants at recommended doses. Sudden death has <br />
        occurred in children and adolescents with structural cardiac abnormalities and other serious cardiac problems, and in adults taking CNS <br />
        stimulants at recommended doses for ADHD. Avoid use in patients with known structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious<br />
        cardiac arrhythmias, coronary artery disease, or other serious cardiac problems. Further evaluate patients who develop exertional chest<br />
        pain, unexplained syncope, or arrhythmias during treatment with Quillivant XR.
    </li>
    <li>
        CNS stimulants cause an increase in blood pressure (mean increase approximately 2‐4 mm Hg) and heart rate (mean increase<br />
        approximately 3‐6 bpm). Some individuals may have larger increases. Monitor all patients for hypertension and tachycardia.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use of stimulants may cause psychotic or manic symptoms in patients with no prior history, or exacerbation of symptoms in patients with<br />
        pre‐existing psychiatric illness. Evaluate for bipolar disorder prior to Quillivant XR use.
    </li>
    <li>
        Cases of painful and prolonged penile erections and priapism have been reported with methylphenidate products. Immediate medical <br />
        attention should be sought if signs or symptoms of prolonged penile erections or priapism are observed.
    </li>
    <li>
        Stimulants used to treat ADHD are associated with peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud’s phenomenon. Careful observation for <br />
        digital changes is necessary during treatment with ADHD stimulants.
    </li>
    <li>
        CNS stimulants have been associated with weight loss and slowing of growth rate in pediatric patients. Growth should be monitored<br />
        during treatment with stimulants, including Quillivant XR. Patients who are not growing or gaining weight as expected may need to have <br />
        their treatment interrupted.
    </li>
    <li>
        Based on accumulated data from other methylphenidate products, the most common (≥5% and twice the rate of placebo) adverse<br />
           reactions are appetite decreased, insomnia, nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, weight decreased, anxiety, dizziness,  <br />
        irritability, affect lability, tachycardia, and blood pressure increased. There is limited experience with Quillivant XR in controlled trials.<br />
          Based on this limited experience, the adverse reaction profile of Quillivant XR appears similar to other methylphenidate extended‐release<br />
        products. The most common (≥2% in the Quillivant XR group and greater than placebo) adverse reactions reported in the Phase 3<br />
        controlled study conducted in 45 ADHD patients (aged 6‐12 years) were affect lability (9%), excoriation (4%), initial insomnia (2%),<br />
        tic (2%), decreased appetite (2%), vomiting (2%), motion sickness (2%), eye pain (2%), and rash (2%).
    </li>
    <li>
        Based on animal data, use of Quillivant XR during pregnancy may cause fetal harm. Quillivant XR should be used during pregnancy only if<br />
        the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.
    </li>
    <li>
        Nursing mothers should be advised to discontinue drug or discontinue nursing, taking into consideration the importance of the drug to<br />
        the mother because methylphenidate is present in human milk.

<p class="isi-heading margins">INDICATION</p>
<p class="indication_content">
    Quillivant XR is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant indicated for the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The<br />
    efficacy of Quillivant XR was established in a 2‐week, placebo-controlled trial in children aged 6 to 12 years with a diagnosis of ADHD.<br />
    Accumulated efficacy data from other methylphenidate products were also considered.
